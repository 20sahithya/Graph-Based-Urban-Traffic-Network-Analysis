# Graph-Based-Urban-Traffic-Network-Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing road networks as graphs. By leveraging Python's powerful libraries like NetworkX, PyTorch, and matplotlib, the project explores the properties of nodes, edges, and the overall network structure. 

## Features
- **Node Analysis**: Map graph nodes to real-world intersections using latitude and longitude.
- **Graph Visualization**: Use NetworkX and matplotlib to create intuitive visual representations of road networks.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: (Optional) Utilize PyTorch for advanced network modeling or feature extraction.
